> **Note**:
> This may not be the module you want to import, it produced to be used as a shared dependency inside the Lectern monorepo. If you are building an application that will interact with a Lectern Server consider using the [Lectern Client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@overture-stack/lectern-client) which includes this libary as a dependency while also providing REST Client functionality.
