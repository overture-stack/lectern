# Lectern UI - Developer Docs

## Developer Quick Start and Storybook 

The codebase contains a [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) development environment that can be used to explore and develop the components in this package.

To run Storybook:

1. Install all dependencies:

```sh
pnpm install
```

2. Run Storybook

```sh
pnpm storybook
```

Storybook will run on port 6006 by default: [http://localhost:6006/](http://localhost:6006/)

## Editing Stories

All stories are located at [../stories](../stories).

### Theme Decorator

All Lectern Components rely on the [`LecternThemeProvider`](../src/theme/ThemeContext.tsx). If this provider is not present, they will render using the default [`LecternTheme`](../src/theme/index.ts).

In order to help testing Lectern-UI Components with alternate themes, a [`themeDecorator`](../stories//themeDecorator.tsx) is provided to be used in stories. The `themeDecorator` can be added to any component story as follows:

```ts
import themeDecorator from '../themeDecorator'; // import from stories/themeDecorator.tsx

const meta = {
	component: MyComponent,
	title: 'Category Name/My Component',
	tags: ['autodocs'],

	// INCLUDE THE DECORATOR HERE:
	decorators: [themeDecorator()],
} satisfies Meta<typeof MyComponent>;
```

To help with testing, a global property named `theme` has been set, and a selector has been added tot he Storybook Toolbar:

![Storybook Global Theme Selector Toolbar](./images/global-theme-selector.png)

The theme selected from the toolbar theme selection tool will be applied to all stories with the `themeDecorator`.

At the moment there is only one alternate theme provided. It is defined inside the `themeDecorator` file - to test alternate stylings please update this custom theme.


#### Adding Additional Themes
To add additional themes in the drop down for the `themeDecorator` to use, you must add an option for the storybook `globalType.theme` property. This is done in the [`../.storybook/preview.ts`](../.storybook/preview.ts) file:

```ts
const preview: Preview = {
	globalTypes: {
		theme: {
			description: 'Display theme used for all components with the themeDecorator.',
			toolbar: {
				icon: 'paintbrush',
				items: [
					{ value: 'default', right: 'âœ…', title: 'Default Theme' },
					{ value: 'custom', right: 'ðŸŽ¨', title: 'Custom Theme' },
					{ value: 'newTheme', right: '{choose an emoji}', title: 'Your New Theme' },
				],
			},
		},
	},
	// ...
}
```

Now that we have an additional option, the `themeDecorator` must be provided the specified theme. The logic for providing the selected theme to the decorator is handled in the [`themeDecorator`](../stories/themeDecorator.tsx) file in the function `function getGlobalTheme(globalTheme: string)`. Add a new case for the `globalType.theme` value that you added to `./storybook/preview.ts`.

```ts
function getGlobalTheme(globalTheme: string): PartialTheme {
	switch (globalTheme) {
		case 'custom': {
			return customTheme;
		}
		case 'newTheme': {
			// Return your new theme
			return { };
		}
		default: {
				return {};
		}
	}
}
```
